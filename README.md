## Build Process 
With the introduction of Node.js, Inquirer and NPM the concept of approaching a project from a different prospect was difficult. I was not comfortable with using NPM and kept believing I needed to look for additional libraryâ€™s to do my work. However, with the help of Luke's video during the preclass I started to understand the base requirements of the class. It wasn't difficult after that but I was left with many questions.


<a name="Issues">

## Project Issues 
Things got a little carried away after I downloaded a premade Readme.MD file that was highly customisable node.js file. Whilst this gave me a scope of how powerful Node.js can be, it also severed as another deterrent to getting my project finished. In the end I kept things simple and tried my best to just get the project finished given I was running out of time.


<a name="Installation">

## Installation 
Inside the folder type 'npm install'. After this is finished type 'node index.js'


<a name="Usuage">

## Usuage 
To generate a Readme.Md file with a guide
  

<a name="Tests">

## Tests
Ran out of time. Currently no true test committed.
